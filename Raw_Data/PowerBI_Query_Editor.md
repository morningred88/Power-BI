# The Power BI Query Editor

## Table name
On the right hand side of Query Editor, we've got Properties pane, the important thing to call out here is table name. It's really important to be strategic and clear with your table names right off the bat, because it can be pretty big headache to change them later on, especially if you've already reference them in multiple calculated fields and measures. So rule of thumb, **be strategic and careful about your table names from step one**.
