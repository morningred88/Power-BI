# Data view

We have several queries imported now. If you click data view, you see the  preview of all the queries. The format of a column in the query is that you can see when you put it in a table in a visual.

For example:
In AW_Calendar_Lookup table, Date column has the date format Thursday, June 8, 2017, which is 6/8/2017 in Query Editor. 

In Data view, you can see Table Tools tab and Column Tools tab if you have a table or column selected. 

## Format data type in Column Tools tab

### Format the column with Date data type to short date 

Go to AW_Calendar_Lookup table, select Date column > Table Tools tab > Confirm the data type as Date> Format, click down arrow, select the first one, short date. Now the value change to the format of 6/8/2017.

The same procedure for columns: Start of week, start of Month, Start of Year

Then in AW_Sales query, format OrderDate and StockDate also as short date.
